### OSMaaS

Mobility as a Service (MaaS) is a way to enable individuals a transportation method – for example, a bike, car or bus – depending on their needs. It is a shift from personally owned modes of transportation towards mobility provided as a service. OSMaaS is a Synergy project within the Halmstad University Knowledge and Competence Center. The intradisciplinary project aims to develop MaaS platforms using service design methods. Subprojects are within Business Model Innovation, Design Ethnography and Technical Design. 

OSMaaS has different sub-projects, which include a technical design that develops the platform’s logic and the necessary optimizations. It includes search algorithms for complex combinations of different travel modalities and discovery and management of users’ preferences. Given the access to user mobility patterns via the product design, the project will provide tools to do a meaningful analysis of user data based on the actual use of the platform. The sub-project is motivated by the need for reliable and optimized handling of data to achieve a positive user experience, both in terms of efficiency and relevance and to provide input to the development of new services and businesses from big data, machine learning and AI technologies.
